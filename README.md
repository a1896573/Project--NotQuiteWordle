# Project--NotQuiteWordls
This is a personal project I attempted in my free time

It's a word guessing game, where the user chooses the length of the word.
Bold- correct letter, correct place
Italic- correct letter, wrong place

The attached TXT file has a list of 7 letter words, but this can be changed and more words can be added to fit user requirements.
